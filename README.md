# Complete Information about the Spotify Playlist Analysis Project
# Step 1: Create a Spotify API to Extract Data
Create a Spotify Developer Account: Go to the Spotify Developer Dashboard.
Log in with your Spotify account or create one if you don’t have one.
Create a New App:
Click on Create an App.
Fill in the required details and create your app.
Once the app is created, you’ll get a Client ID and Client Secret. Save these credentials.

# Step 2: Extract Data from Spotify
Go to the Spotify Web API Documentation:
Refer to the Spotify Web API Documentation for sample codes required to extract data in various programming languages (preferably Python).
To extract any data from Spotify, you need the playlist ID:
Open Spotify and navigate to the playlist you want to analyze.
Right-click on the playlist and select Share -> Copy Playlist Link to get the playlist ID.

# Step 3: Extract Playlist Data
From the playlist ID, extract various sections of data such as:
Playlist Metadata (e.g., playlist name, description, total tracks).
Tracks Data (e.g., track name, artist name, album name, popularity, duration).
Artists Data (e.g., artist name, genres, followers).
All these data come in JSON format by default.

# Step 4: Data Extraction Using AWS Lambda
Create a Lambda Function for Data Extraction:
Use AWS Lambda to process your Python code that extracts data from the Spotify API and saves it to AWS S3, which is used to store all the raw data files and add 
spotify layer to this code

# Step 5: Data Transformation Using AWS Lambda
Create a Lambda Function for Data Transformation:
Use AWS Lambda for processing and transforming the extracted data. Transform the JSON data into a structured format (e.g., CSV) and save the transformed data to another S3 bucket. Add AWSSDKpythonforpandas layer for the data transformation, as aws does not support the python environment from outside.

#  Step 6: Load Data into Snowflake
Create Snowflake Tables:
Use Snowflake to create tables for storing the transformed data.
Set Up Snowpipe:
Configure Snowpipe to automatically load data from S3 into Snowflake tables.

# Step 7: Automate the Process
Use AWS CloudWatch to Trigger Lambda Functions:
Schedule AWS CloudWatch to trigger the Lambda function for data extraction. Within the Lambda function, call another Lambda function to perform data transformation. Once the transformed data is stored in S3, use Snowpipe to automatically load the data into Snowflake.

# Step 8: Configure Permissions for Lambda
Attach Required Permissions:

In the Lambda function, go to Configurations -> Permissions.
Attach permissions such as S3 full access and AWS Lambda service role to coordinate between Lambda and S3 services.
Create Storage Integration for Snowflake:
Create a new role in AWS IAM with S3 full access. Use the ARN value from the IAM role for STORAGE_AWS_ROLE_ARN in Snowflake.
Describe the integration in Snowflake and copy the STORAGE_AWS_IAM_USER_ARN and STORAGE_AWS_EXTERNAL_ID values. Replace the AWS and External ID values in the IAM role's trust relationship with these values.
After creating pipes in Snowflake, describe the pipe (DESC PIPE PIPENAME) and copy the notification channel column. Create an event notification in the S3 bucket properties using this notification channel.

# Step 9: Connect Power BI to Snowflake
Open Power BI:
Click on Get Data and select Snowflake.
Enter Snowflake Server and Warehouse Details:
Go to Snowflake account info, find the active account, and copy the URL.
Remove http:// and paste it in the server field.
Enter the warehouse name you are working with in the warehouse name field.
